# Quick Search Chrome Extension

A convenient way to google search words directly on the browser. Simply highlight a word and hit a customizable hotkey resulting in a new tab with a google search of the highlighted phrase.

## Goal

I was annoyed at hitting 3 hotkeys instead of 1 so I made this. You're welcome :D
